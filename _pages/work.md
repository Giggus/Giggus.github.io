    excerpt: '**Project Manager & Mechatronics Engineer**


    In July 2017 I joint the [Rehab Technologies Lab](http://rehab.iit.it/) of the Italian Institute of Technology ([IIT](https://www.iit.it/)). The Rehab Technologies Lab is specialized in creating robotic prosthesis and orthoses for amputees and people with reduced mobility. My main task was to manage two projects: 

    - [Float] an upper-limb exoskeleton for rehabilitation of shoulder and scapula injuries
    
    - [TWIN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmQJDGQBvyY&t=12s) a lower-limb exoskeleton to assist patients with paralyzed limbs to walk
