Hi! My name is Giulio Cerruti. I am from Imperia (Italy) and now I am living in Bristol.
<br><br>
From 2014-2017 I worked as Robotics Engineer at the Advanced Mechatronics Lab of [Softbank Robotics Europe](https://www.ald.softbankrobotics.com/en) - previously known as Aldebaran - in Nantes. In July 2017 I joined the [Rehab Technology lab](http://rehab.iit.it/) at the Italian Institute of Technology ([IIT](https://www.iit.it/)). I moved to Bristol in January 2019 to joint the Robotics Research team at [Dyson](https://www.dyson.co.uk/en.html). See [here](/work/) for more information.
